This is a list of things left to be done

    1, Change the uuid3 from a debug one, for most of the app features to work.

    2, Revamp the UI

    3, Refactor the code (Obviously still looks very messy)

    4, Make the application start up, after the phone completes booting.

    5, Make sure the application doesn't close when the user presses the "Red" button
        on devices that have them.

    6, The update module still needs to bew completed, To communicate with the a
        domain the check for available updates

    7, There is still no user documentation
